Simulation:
Assume a customer arrives at the bank. They can go to a teller or financial advisor.
The teller and financial advisor will offer a customer to make a new account or provide
their respective services to the customer for an existing account.
Both teller and financial advisor will go through the Bank manager to implement any changes
to the customer account.
The bank will have it's own balance to start with and loans will be calculated based off the available
funds plus interest.
